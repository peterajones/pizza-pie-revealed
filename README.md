### `Reveal the pizza slices`

A pretty simple vanilla JS project to reveal the slices of a pizza.

This required doing a bunch of math to figure out the geometry of the pizza slices and then covering them up with transform: rotate.

When you select a number of slices, the covered up piece(s) are slowly revealed by changing the opacity with a CSS transform.

Makes you hungry!
